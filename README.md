# CPACC
CPACC is short for _Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies_, a certificate provided by _International Association of Accessibility Professionals_ ([IAAP](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/)).

In this repository I'll document my progress into studying for my CPACC exam. I will be mainly following the [Deque University CPACC Class](https://dequeuniversity.com/class/iaap-cpacc) and write down summaries in markdown files in this repository.
