# [Types of Disabilities](https://dequeuniversity.com/class/iaap-cpacc/types-of-disabilities/)

> [!NOTE]Learning Goals of this Section
> In learning the different types of disabilities, you should be able to demonstrate the following skills:
> 1. Name the main categories of disabilities.
> 2. Classify specific conditions under their relevant disability category or categories.
> 3. Define assistive technologies.
> 4. Match disability categories with relevant assistive technologies.
> 5. Describe the accessibility challenges faced by people with disabilities of a given category.
> 6. Given a scenario or narrative in an applied domain, identify accessibility challenges for people of various kinds of disabilities, and potential solutions to overcome those challenges.
> 7. Rate the appropriateness of a proposed solution for a person with a specific disability.

## Blindness

### Description
Blindness is generally characterized as sightlessness or a loss of vision. While the term “blindness” is often used to define a total loss of vision, it may also refer to partial blindness, where sight may be extremely limited.

### Challenges & Solutions for people with Blindness

#### `[ICT]` Cannot see digital or electronic interfaces
- Screen readers can read interfaces and content out loud to users by converting digital text to synthesized speech.
- Self-voicing interfaces and applications can communicate to users.
- Refreshable braille output devices use screen readers to convert digital text to braille.

#### `[ICT]` Cannot use screen readers on digital content and interfaces
- Interface designers and content authors can edit the markup to make it compatible with the assistive technologies.

#### `[ARCHITECTURE]` Cannot see when walking
- Canes help blind people feel their surroundings as they walk.
- Service animals help them navigate their surroundings.
- GPS-based walking instructions with an audio interface.
- Raised tiles on the ground to indicate the edge of a platform.
- Eliminate low-hanging architectural features that a blind person could bump into.
- Clear pathways without obstructions in hallways, sidewalks.

#### `[ARCHITECTURE]` Cannot see signs or other text
- Map and geolocation applications on mobile devices can announce related information.
- Braille labels and descriptions can allow to explore and understand their surroundings.
- Tactile models of the exterior form a mental map of their surroundings.

#### `[CONSUMER]` Cannot see or feel the controls on flat interfaces on devices (eg. dishwashers)
- Alternative interfaces with knobs or other tactile controls
- Audio interfaces
- Remote control through applications on mobile devices

#### `[CONSUMER]` Cannot read the text on the containers or packaging
- Embossed braille (or braille stickers) on packaging and product containers help consumers identify items

#### `[CONSUMER]` Cannot read money to determine its value
- Applications on mobile devices can photograph the money and read the value to blind people.
- Paper bills and coins could be manufactured in different sizes, shapes, or textures to allow blind people to distinguish the value based on touch.
- Non-cash systems of payment can allow blind people to make financial transactions via a device with screen readers or self-voicing output.

#### `[CONSUMER]` Cannot read print
- Optical character recognition software can convert scanned images of text into digital text readable by screen readers.
- Information can be placed online or in other digital formats to be read using their own assistive technologies.
