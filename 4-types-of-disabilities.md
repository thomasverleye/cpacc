## Blindness

### Description
Blindness is generally characterized as sightlessness or a loss of vision. While the term “blindness” is often used to define a total loss of vision, it may also refer to partial blindness, where sight may be extremely limited.

They use screenreaders to use software, read content and browse the web.

### Challenges & Solutions for people with Blindness

#### `[ICT]` Cannot see digital or electronic interfaces
- Screen readers can read interfaces and content out loud to users by converting digital text to synthesized speech.
- Self-voicing interfaces and applications can communicate to users.
- Refreshable braille output devices use screen readers to convert digital text to braille.

#### `[ICT]` Cannot use screen readers on digital content and interfaces
- Interface designers and content authors can edit the markup to make it compatible with the assistive technologies.

#### `[ARCHITECTURE]` Cannot see when walking
- Canes help blind people feel their surroundings as they walk.
- Service animals help them navigate their surroundings.
- GPS-based walking instructions with an audio interface.
- Raised tiles on the ground to indicate the edge of a platform.
- Eliminate low-hanging architectural features that a blind person could bump into.
- Clear pathways without obstructions in hallways, sidewalks.

#### `[ARCHITECTURE]` Cannot see signs or other text
- Map and geolocation applications on mobile devices can announce related information.
- Braille labels and descriptions can allow to explore and understand their surroundings.
- Tactile models of the exterior form a mental map of their surroundings.

#### `[CONSUMER]` Cannot see or feel the controls on flat interfaces on devices (eg. dishwashers)
- Alternative interfaces with knobs or other tactile controls
- Audio interfaces
- Remote control through applications on mobile devices

#### `[CONSUMER]` Cannot read the text on the containers or packaging
- Embossed braille (or braille stickers) on packaging and product containers help consumers identify items

#### `[CONSUMER]` Cannot read money to determine its value
- Applications on mobile devices can photograph the money and read the value to blind people.
- Paper bills and coins could be manufactured in different sizes, shapes, or textures to allow blind people to distinguish the value based on touch.
- Non-cash systems of payment can allow blind people to make financial transactions via a device with screen readers or self-voicing output.

#### `[CONSUMER]` Cannot read print
- Optical character recognition software can convert scanned images of text into digital text readable by screen readers.
- Information can be placed online or in other digital formats to be read using their own assistive technologies.

## Low Vision
People with low vision can see, but their vision is still quite far from perfect even with powerful corrective lenses. Those who have low vision may be unable to see well enough to drive or read most printed text unless they enlarge it. Low vision isn't a single condition.

As they have different conditions they will also use different assitive technologies to use digital devices:
- Screen magnification (to enlarge small text);
- Screen readers (helpfull for them to hear the text as well);
- Color Customization (for better contrast or to avoid bright white light)

### Challenges & Solutions for people with Low Vision

#### `[GENERAL]` Small text can be hard to read
- Screen magnifiers can enlarge the items on the screen to make them easier to read.
- Utilities to enhance contrast, change colors, or alter other aspects of visual appearance can improve legibility.
- Screen readers can supplement screen magnifiers by reading interfaces and content out loud to users through synthesized speech.
- Self-voicing interfaces (eg ATMs) and applications can communicate to users without the need for a screen reader.
- Alternative large print versions of small print text can make printed materials easier to read.
- Alternative digital versions of printed materials can give users the ability to read the materials using their own assistive technologies.

#### `[GENERAL]` Low contrast text can be hard to read
- Software or hardware options can enhance the contrast of digital text.
- Interface designers and content creators can choose color combinations with high enough contrast to easily read.

## Color Blindness
Color-blindness does not literally mean that a person can't see any color at all (except in very rare cases). Color-blindness refers to the inability to distinguish between certain kinds of colors, especially colors that are of equal brightness or luminosity, even if the colors themselves appear quite different to people without color-blindness.

Common solution for people with color blindness: **do not use ONLY color for information**.

### Types of Color Blindness
There are several types of color blindness and it's a spectrum in how they may vary so it's quite hard to sum up which are the worst.

- **red-green color-blindness** (Common sub types: Deuteranopia and Protanopia);
- **blue-yellow color-blindness** (Rare sub type: Tritanopia);
- **grayscale color-blindness** (Very rare sub type: Achromatopsia);
- **red-Black color-blindness** (no name or subtype)

### Challenges & Solutions for people with color blindness

#### `[GENERAL]` Certain color combinations can be difficult to distinguish
- Materials can be designed in a way that does not depend on color as a way to convey information.

## Deafblindness

### Description
For a descriptions of both disabilities see [Blindness](#blindness) and [Auditory Disabilities](#auditory-disabilities).

Their only option in assitive technologies is **braille**. They mainly going to use the refreshable braille display in combination with a screen reader.

### Challenges & Solutions for people with deafblindness

#### `[ICT]` Digital text cannot be seen
- A screen reader can convert text to braille on a refreshable braille device, or "printed" in a braille embosser.

#### `[ICT]` Audio & Video cannot be heard nor seen
- A text transcript of the audio can be converted to refreshable braille by a screen reader, or "printed" in a braille embosser.

## Auditory Disabilities
There are several types of Auditory Disabilities:
- Hearing impairment;
- Hearing loss;
- Deafness;

Hearing impairment or hearing loss have diminished hearing and may have difficulty understanding speech and distinguishing foreground noise from background noise.  
Some of them depend on **hearing aid or lip reading**.

For people with total loss they depend on **sign language or communication board**.

Causes of this disabilities varies, it may include genetics, premature birth, infections/illnesses, ear trauma, exposure to loud noises, aging, ...

deaf and Deaf (see capitalization) mean different things. Deaf with a capital refers to the Deaf community & culture. Deafness is not viewed as a loss by those in the Deaf community.

### Challenges & Solutions for people with Auditroy disabilities

#### `[ICT]` The audio or audio portion of videos cannot be heard
- Provide synchronized captions with videos
- Provide sign language interpretation

#### `[GENERAL]` Speeches and talks cannot be heard by deaf people in the room
- Provide sign language interpretation
- Provide live captions on a monitor during the speech

#### `[ARCHITECTURE]` Doorbells, alarms, and other sounds may not be heard
- Provide alternative visual alerts, such as lights that flash, pulse, dim, turn on, or turn off.

## Mobility, Flexibility, and Body Structure Disabilities

### Description
Mobility disabilities affect a person’s ability to move independently and purposely.

Some examples are people who have missing limbs, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, stroke, partial or complete paralysis, or arthritis may experience limitations with moving their body or parts of their body.

Causes for these disabilities may vary, they can be present from birth, occur due to aging, or be the result of a disease. And they can be temporary, permanent or periodically recur or relapse.

The **abilities and characteritics may vary** because this is a broad category.

### Challenges & Solutions for people with Mobility, Flexibility, and Body Structure Disabilities

#### `[ICT]` May be unable to use a mouse due to difficulty or inability to use hands
- Alternative Hardware (keyboard, stick, ...) or Software (speech recognition, eye tracking, ...) enable users to use a computer without the need for a mouse.
- Developers and designers can ensure digital content is accessible using keyboard devices.

#### `[ICT]` May need more time to interact with digital content and interfaces due to slower movements.
- Interface designers and developers can alert users to session timeouts and provide users with a way to adjust the time, extend the time or turn off the time limit.

#### `[ARCHITECTURE]` Wheelchair users are unable to use steps.
- For building entrances, accessible ramps in addition to steps should be provided, and accessible parking should be provided.
- For steps within buildings, ensure that ramps and elevators are provided and accessible.
- Ensure that accessible routes outside and within the building are labeled and clearly identifiable.

#### `[ARCHITECTURE]` Wheelchairs users may be unable to navigate through tight spaces.
- Doors, hallways, rooms, and restrooms should be wide enough for everyone, including wheelchair users, to use.
- All corridors and routes should be unobstructed.

#### `[ARCHITECTURE]` May have difficulty using hands or arms to open doors.
- Provide automatic doors or doors than can be opened using a large button.
- Equip doors with lever-type handles/doorknobs for easier opening or closing.

#### `[ARCHITECTURE]` May encounter seating that is too small or at the wrong height.
- Ensure that seating can accommodate a variety of body sizes.

#### `[CONSUMER]` May be unable to turn pages of printed materials.
- Consider providing printed materials in a digital format that may allow people to use their own assistive technologies;

## Cognitive Disabilities

### Description
It is a very large spectrum which is hard to define as a whole but there are a few categories:
- **Limited Comprehension** Some people don't understand complex ideas, have it difficult with methaphors or abstract language. Some may have great cognitive functioning in one area (remembering conversations) but have lower functioning in others (emotional awareness, ...).
- **Low Tolerance for Cognitive Overload** too much input may cause some people to freeze or become frustrated. They need things to be simple and straightforward with not to many choices.
- **Limited Problem-Solving Skills** Some people might not be able to solve problems and may even not attempt it. (for instance a captcha).
- **Short Term Memory Loss** some people may lack the memory doing things in between one moment and the next.
- **Attention Deficit** making it hard for them to focus on the task at hand, they may get lost in their own thoughts.

Causes for these disabilities may vary, birth, development conditions at young age, traumatic injury, infections, chemical imbalance, ...

### Challenges & Solutions for people with Cognitive Disabilities

#### `[ICT]` May find complex designs and tasks in digital format overwhelming
- Create simple, predictable, organized designs and simplify user interface components

#### `[ICT]` May have difficulty solving technical problems or fixing errors
- Ensure users are alerted to errors and provide clear solutions to fix errors

#### `[GENERAL]` May have difficulty processing information, especially text-based information that uses complex language
- Supplement text-based information with images and other visuals to reinforce understanding
- Use simple, easy-to-understand language when presenting text-based information
